# Fragments

Small algorithm challenges solved in Typescript.

Project structure is slightly different from demanded one so it includes the tests:

```

├── src
│ ├── find-odd-amount.ts
│ ├── same-xo-amount.ts
│ └── sum-smallest-numbers.ts
├── tests
│ ├── find-odd-amount.test.ts

│ └── sum-smallest-numbers.test.ts
├── node_modules

└── README.md
```

## Running Tests

This project uses Jest as its testing framework. To execute the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Problem Descriptions and Solutions

The problems solved in this project are as follows:

1. `sumSmallestNumbers()`: Computes the sum of the two smallest numbers in an array.
2. `sameXOAmount()`: Checks if a string contains an equal amount of 'x' and 'o'.
3. `findOddAmount()`: Finds the number that occurs an odd number of times in an array.

Detailed problem descriptions and solution implementations can be found within the respective TypeScript files.
